### Antithesis Project Pre-kick-off meeting

* Overview of the scope of the project, the deadlines, the goal(s), who's involved, and possible outcomes (see [Antithesis' README](./antithesis/README.md)
* discussed how to get started, what's there, what needs to happen
* Got a demo of some tests the team has already worked on that could be good candidate for onboarding and PoC
* Suggestion: we could use cardano-wallet as a driver to generate transactions?
  * would need to have a way to control several wallets
  * Might be overkill at least at start
