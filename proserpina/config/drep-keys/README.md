Keys generated by the --drep-keys flag. These keys are for Delegated Representatives (DReps) that make decisions
related to Cardano governance. Delegators that do not want to vote for each decision will pick DReps in line with
their views delegate their voting power to them. The DRep's in this generated testnet data will automatically get
registered and all the stake delegators (if any) will automatically delegate their vote to one of the DReps here.
